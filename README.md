# LiveJoy

This project, **LiveJoy** demonstrates how to configure a Janet project with a live REPL that lets you interact with the [Joy](https://github.com/joy-framework/joy) web framework at runtime.

This setup allows you to change code in your editor and see updates reflected instantly in your running web server ‚Äî no restarts, no rebuilds.

This same theory may also work for other janet projects, if you need this to work with another blocking tool, it could work for you too !

It might be possible to do this with other repls, but I've only tried emacs.

## üîß Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository


```sh
git clone https://github.com/wmealing/janet-joy-live.git
cd janet-joy-live
```

2. Run the REPL

From the shell:

```sh
jpm -l janet -d main.janet
```

This launches your application in interactive debugger mode via jpm.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You won't be able to interact with the REPL from the shell.

## üíª Connect from Emacs

To interact with the live REPL, use Emacs with a-janet-spork-client:

Install and configure a-janet-spork-client in Emacs.

Load it in your Emacs session.

Within emacs run:

```elisp
M-x ajsc
```

This should connect to 127.0.0.1:9365 by default.

Now you can evaluate expressions in your editor and see changes live in your running Joy server.

## üß™ Live Editing in Action

Open main.janet in your editor.

The server is started using a non-blocking handler that evaluates app on every HTTP request,
this is a slightly modified version of the one provided by the joy framework.

It is already in main.janet , but here it is for completion:

```clojure
(defn nb-server [handler port &opt host max-size]
  (default host "localhost")
  (default max-size 8192)

  (let [port (string port)
        socket (net/server host port)]

    (forever
      (when-let [conn (:accept socket)]
        (ev/call (connection-handler (handler) max-size) conn)
        (print "SLEEPING")
        (ev/sleep 0)))))
```

With the shell command still running , the Joy web app should be available at:

üëâ http://localhost:8080/

### Example: Updating a Heading Live

In your editor, find this line:

```clojure
(def heading-text "This changes live!!")
```

Change the string value, put your cursor at the end of the expression, and run:

```
C-x C-e
```

This sends the new value to the REPL.

Now reload (ctrl+r ) the browser ‚Äî you should see your new heading.

Example: Modify a apage renderer.

You can do the same with:

``` clojure
(defn home [request]
  ...)
```
Change the function body, evaluate it in Emacs, and refresh the page.

üîÆ The future

It might be possible to force a state change and do live javascript reloads, although I'm
not sure how to do that, but it probably uses some kind of websocket and algorithm.  I think
shadow-cljs does it, so it must be possible.  PR's welcome !

üåÄ Why LiveJoy?

- Rapid feedback loop

- Explore Joy at runtime

- Edit and test route handlers live

- Great for prototyping or learning Joy
